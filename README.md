# Data Analytics in Sales Domain




## Overview
This project focuses mainly on the application of sales technique to the sales domain. The primary goal is to find key insights into performance drivers and employ proper business strategies.

The Datasheet which has been added to file is a detailed collection of Sales orders, Customer groups, Sale Regions and Budget for a specific year. 

Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) is performed on the data sheet to find performance data insights using the python libraries - numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn.

The final Datasheet is exported as a csv file from which we found out the KPIs and accordingly formed an interactive Dashboard.
